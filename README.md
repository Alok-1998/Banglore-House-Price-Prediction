# Banglore-House-Price-Prediction

# Introduction
Creating a Machine Learning model to predict the home prices in Bangalore, India. We are going to use the dataset from Kaggle.com. 
We are also going to create a single page website which will provide the front end to access our model for predictions.

# concepts used :-

i. Data loading and cleaning

ii. Outlier detection and removal

iii. Feature engineering

iv. Dimensionality reduction

v. K fold cross validation

# Tools and Technologies used :-  

i. Python

ii. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning

iii. Matplotlib for data visualization

iv. Sklearn for model building

# Steps involved :-

-- We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.

-- Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.

-- Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area,
bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

Step-1: Import the required libraries
Step-2: Load the data
Step-3: Understand the data
Step-4: Data Cleaning
Step-5: Build Machine Learning Model
Step-6: Testing The model
Step-7: Export the model

# Conclusion :-

With the help of this project i have predicted the price of a property in a certain locality on the basis of different parameters like land area, location, no. of Bdrroms halls and kitchens. The accuracy of this project is 88%.
